This is (will be?) an xml level loader thing for cocos2d/chipmunk!

Note it only really works on an iPad device at the moment (it uses tilt so doesn't work for simulator, and all 
the resolutions are for iPad only)

Future Additions:
- Portals to properly move between "rooms"
- Some better control variations
- iPhone compatible
